The Prototypes were created using Proto.io

The 4 main parts of the app are: User Profile, Learning Section, Resources Page and Requesting Ally.

- User Profile: Contains the user details like User Name, Pronouns and Status (student, faculty or staff), 
Hours dedicated to helping as an Ally, Rating as an Ally and Bio where the user can introduce themselves. 
Lastly, Badges are earned after completing courses to show their qualifications as an ally. 

- Learning: Users can find courses on how to become an active ally to the community. Upon completion of a course, 
users will be awarded with badges to prove their qualifications. More courses and workshops will be suggested in the Top Picks based on the user activity. 
so this will show courses of topics the user has shown interest in. 

- Resources: Will contain links to various resources available in campus all in one place. Allows the Users to easily find specific resources that they need, 
rather then having to search through websites to find their required information

- Requesting Ally: Users will be able to request for an Ally while choosing the Level of urgency: 
for example they can schedule a meeting with an Ally or ask for immediate assistance, Description of the situation and Preference for an Ally, 
because users may want to talk to an ally who they are comfortable with. 
Users will be able to rate their Ally and write reviews after their meetings or interactions which will then be visible on the User Profile.
